This camera was specifically purchased to replace my Samsung Gear 360 which easily produces 360 video, but has sub-par video quality. Given that the GoPro Omni runs about $1,400, the GoPro Fusion is a steal at less than half that cost."},

The housing is 2-3 times larger than even the largest other GoPro models, the battery is about twice as large, and the camera requires two micro-SD cards to even function (one card for the forward-facing lens, and one card for the rear-facing lens). The files are also HUGE (more on that later). Thankfully though, even though the camera is physically much larger than any other GoPro before it, it still uses the same versatile mounts."},

I was totally unable to stitch and render any 360 video on my phone because of the massive space requirements, so I downloaded the Windows 10 desktop software. When I then tried to stitch and render a video of approximately 1.5 minutes in length, I could see that the resulting file would take hours to render (not including the time it'd take to then upload it later to YouTube) and would be nearly six gigabytes in size. To be clear, that's one huge video. This estimated size I was given for a 1.5 minute video with the GoPro Fusion was the same as the average rip of a 2-hour Blu-Ray video."},

Unless you're going to stick to filming videos of only a few seconds in length, any videos that are a few minutes in length will require hours of your time. That's just too heavy of a commitment for me to have the latest/greatest in \"wow\" factor videos. I'd rather invest the time and money in full-frame video from a mirrorless camera or using another GoPro action cam."},

GoPro, you can do better in sending a simple 10 page quick start guide, I know all the materials are in the video but...  I first did not know where the buttons were, I finally figured that out, then by accident paired with the phone and from there things became easier.

Using the free Fusion Studio app on Mac (haven't tried the Windows version), you can render out very nice video images with gimbal-like stabilization. It's the best stabilization I've ever seen on a 360 camera. Even with walking and micro vibrations, the hardware/software combination yields buttery-smooth movement. Using the Fusion is like having 2 GoPro Heros strapped back to back, and the Fusion Studio software allows you to do what GoPro calls \"overcapture\" which is to say you can do 16:9 HD or 4:3 cutouts from any part of the 360 sphere. But to be clear, you don't need Fusion Studio to do 16:9 cutouts. This can easily be done in Final Cut Pro X or Premiere by putting the equirectangular clips into a standard 1080 timeline, then adjusting the orientation of the sphere. The footage cuts perfectly into a project with other GoPro aquired1080 footage. Now the not-so-good news. The app itself is really, really slow to stitch. I have an iMac Pro 8 Core and 12 minutes of video took 8 hours to render!! Fortunately, I use another Pro stitching software, and it only took 1 hour for the same footage. So GoPro has to improve how the app is using the CPU. Assuming your clips are relatively short and you're patient, (let the clips render overnight) the camera is truly the best 360 camera I've used (and I've used a lot of them).\n"},

How can a camera of this price, category, and technology omit the MOST BASIC OF ALL CAMERA FUNCTIONS?  I can think of no camera released in the past 10yrs that costs 1/10th of this one that blows off the implementation of Exposure and White Balance Control.  Literally, you CANNOT lock your exposure or WB and cannot choose shutter speeds.  Sure..AUTO EVERYTHING with a simple +/- EV control can work fine in easy environments... but go in and out of shadows, mixed light...shoot time lapse, etc and watch that exposure and white balance bounce all over the place.  I honestly expected more from GoPro and it never even crossed my mind that these BASIC features would be excluded.  For me, I may just have to return it as I cannot accept these limitations no matter how great it looks in bright even sunlight.  PLEASE FIX THIS and I may repurchase.  Interesting that there are so many comments marked \"Helpful\" when they are \"rah rah\"...but there are some big-time shortcomings that people should consider and not be swayed exclusively by only positive reviews.  One additional - Be sure you don't mind a 10x-15x to 1 rendering ratio on even the latest of computers.  1min of footage will take 10-15min to render.  For reference, my latest top of line Macbook Pro it's 10 to 1.\n"},

Find the Fusion Studio app, right-click, select 'Set Affinity'.  You need to limit the number of corse the Fusion Studio app has access to.

I don't do too many fancy things with it.  We are an all Mac household so I stitch and edit videos through my desktop.  It runs more slowly on smaller devices but runs very well on my higher processor desktop.  Everything else pales in comparison to the 360 if you take into consideration the 3D nature of the videos.  The video quality will catch up eventually, given the new software in beta.  I am very much looking forward to these improvements and remain a hardcore avid customer/fan of GoPro.
